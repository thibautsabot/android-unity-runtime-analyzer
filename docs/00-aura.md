# AURA — Android Unity Runtime Analyzer

Before opening a tool like JADX or apktool, the first question is usually:

> _What am I even looking at?_

AURA can answer that question. It is entirely optional — every step in this handbook works without it. But if you prefer to start with a quick overview before deciding which tools are relevant, AURA gives you that in one command. It inspects an APK, XAPK or APKS package and tells you:

- Which **framework** the application is built with (Unity, Flutter, React Native, Unreal, Godot, Cocos2d-x, ...)
- Which **scripting backend** is used (IL2CPP, Mono)
- Which **third-party SDKs** are present (Firebase, AppsFlyer, Facebook, Google Ads, ...)
- Basic **manifest metadata** (package name, version, SDK levels, permissions, security flags)
- A **recommended workflow** — which tools to use next, based on what was detected

This gives you a clear starting point before diving into any of the tools covered in this handbook.

## Installation

```sh
npm install -g android-unity-runtime-analyzer
```

Requires Node.js ≥ 20.

---

## Usage

### inspect

Analyzes an APK, XAPK or APKS package and prints a detection report.

```sh
aura inspect app.apk
aura inspect app.xapk
aura inspect app.apks
```

Add `--verbose` (or `-v`) to also show the full list of activities, services, receivers, providers, permissions and evidence locations:

```sh
aura inspect app.apk --verbose
```

### doctor

Checks whether the tools needed for Android and Unity reverse engineering are installed and reachable on PATH.

```sh
aura doctor
```

Run only specific categories:

```sh
aura doctor --android
aura doctor --frida
aura doctor --native
aura doctor --unity
```

## Where AURA fits in the workflow

AURA is an optional starting point. If you run it, it identifies the framework, backend and SDKs upfront — information that determines which tools are relevant and in which order to use them. If you already know what you're looking for, you can skip it and go straight to any of the chapters below.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    APK["Application.apk"]
    APK --> AURA["AURA\n(identify framework + SDKs)"]
    AURA --> JADX["JADX\n(Java layer)"]
    AURA --> ASSETRIPPER["AssetRipper\n(Unity assets)"]
    AURA --> IL2CPP["Il2CppDumper / Cpp2IL\n(managed types)"]
    AURA --> GHIDRA["Ghidra / IDA\n(native code)"]
```

Without AURA, you'd open JADX on a Unity IL2CPP game and wonder why there's almost no Java code — because the actual logic is in `libil2cpp.so`. AURA tells you that upfront.
